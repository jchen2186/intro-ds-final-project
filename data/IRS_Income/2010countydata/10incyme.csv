"In general, during administrative or Master File processing, taxpayer
reporting discrepancies are corrected only to the extent necessary to
verify the total tax liability reported.  Most of the other corrections to
the taxpayer records used for these statistics could not be made
because of time and resource constraints.  The statistics in the 
county data should, therefore, be used with the knowledge that 
some of the data have not been perfected or edited for statistical 
purposes and that State totals in this table may not be altogether 
comparable to other State totals published by the IRS,
