Team 4: James, Jane, Pooneet, Tahsin
## Objective
Our project revolves around mortality rates in the United States and the factors that affect them. Some factors that we plan to look into include income, education, and air quality. Our goal is to compare the how strongly correlated the various factors are with mortality and understand where efforts need to be taken to help reduce loss of life.
